# Pipeline-ESP32
This project is intended to create a DevOps Pipeline for Internet of Things devices, in this case an ESP32 Board. The main objective is to have a workflow with a set of actions to trigger when a repository push includes changes in the source code directory.

## Getting Started
To get started you need to fork this repository on your own GitHub account, because you will need to set up an access token for the runner permissions.
